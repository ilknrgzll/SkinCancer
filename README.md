# 🧠 Skin Cancer Detection with Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based **image classification** and **data analysis** system developed to assist in the early detection of skin cancer. It leverages Python, TensorFlow, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify skin lesion images. A modern, responsive frontend is built using React.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Image Classification:** Accurate classification of skin lesions using CNN architecture
- 🗂️ **Dataset:** Real-world skin lesion images sourced from Kaggle
- 🧑‍⚕️ **Target Audience:** Designed for medical professionals and researchers
- ⏱️ **Early Diagnosis Support:** Aims to assist in early detection and faster treatment processes
- 💻 **React Frontend:** Interactive and user-friendly interface for result visualization

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- React
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (for data processing and visualization)
